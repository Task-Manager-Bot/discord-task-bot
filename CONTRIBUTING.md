# How to contribute

First of all, thanks for taking the time out to contribute!
Make sure to follow the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Testing

There's no testing in place at the moment. A pull request for the same will be very much appreciated.

## How to report a bug or a new feature?

If you find a bug, or if you're looking for a new feature, create a new `Issue` with proper description.

## Beginner?

Check the Issues labelled as `good-first-issue`.

## How to submit changes?

Create Pull Requests only for existing Issues (which are assigned to you). If you want to be assigned to an issue, comment on the issue

### Create a branch

1. `git checkout master` from any folder in your local discord-task-bot repository
2. `git pull origin master` to ensure you have the latest main code
3. `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (replacing the-name-of-my-branch with a suitable name) to create a branch

2. Save the files and check in the browser
